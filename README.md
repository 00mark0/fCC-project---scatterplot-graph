# Scatterplot Graph Project

This project is a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum and focuses on creating a scatterplot graph using D3.js.

## Project Description

The scatterplot graph displays a collection of data points as individual circles on a graph. Each data point represents two numerical values, one on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. The position of each circle on the graph corresponds to its respective x and y values.

## Technologies Used
